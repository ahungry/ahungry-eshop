The nintendo eshop UI is...not the best.

There are some existing phone apps to find "best deals", but again,
I'm not a huge fan of the UI, so this is an attempt to implement a
more friendly/usable thing for myself (at the least, using sqlite as a
query engine to grab out useful results).

Maybe I'll extend it to a UI with updated thumbnails...
